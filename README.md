# GitHub Actions CICD Pipeline

## Shared vs Private Self-Hosted Runners


| Aspect | Shared Runners (GitHub-hosted) | Private Self-Hosted Runners |
|--------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Infrastructure Management** | Fully managed by GitHub | Self-managed infrastructure |
| **Setup Complexity** | Zero setup required | Requires installation and configuration |
| **Scalability** | Auto-scaling, unlimited concurrency | Limited by your hardware capacity |
| **Security** | Isolated, ephemeral environments | Full control over security policies |
| **Performance** | Standard GitHub hardware specs | Customizable hardware specifications |
| **Network Access** | Public internet only | Access to private networks/resources |
| **Software Pre-installed** | GitHub's standard toolset | Custom software stack possible |
| **Maintenance** | Zero maintenance required | Regular updates and patches needed |
| **Availability** | GitHub's SLA (99.9%+) | Depends on your infrastructure |

### Shared Runners (GitHub-hosted)

#### ✅ Pros
- **Zero maintenance** - No infrastructure management required
- **Instant availability** - Ready to use immediately
- **Auto-scaling** - Handles multiple concurrent jobs automatically
- **Clean environment** - Fresh, isolated runner for each job
- **Pre-installed tools** - Common development tools already available
- **GitHub integration** - Seamless integration with GitHub ecosystem

#### ❌ Cons
- **Limited customization** - Cannot install custom software permanently
- **No private network access** - Cannot reach internal systems
- **Performance limitations** - Fixed hardware specifications
- **No persistent storage** - Files don't persist between jobs
- **Limited control** - Cannot modify runner environment significantly
- **Public internet only** - Cannot access private repositories on-premises

### Private Self-Hosted Runners

#### ✅ Pros
- **Full customization** - Install any software or tools needed
- **Private network access** - Can reach internal systems and databases
- **Performance optimization** - Choose hardware specs that fit your needs
- **Persistent storage** - Can maintain files between builds
- **Security control** - Full control over runner environment and data
- **Compliance** - Meet specific regulatory requirements
- **Integration flexibility** - Connect to internal tools and services

#### ❌ Cons
- **Infrastructure overhead** - Must manage, update, and maintain runners
- **Setup complexity** - Requires technical expertise to configure
- **Scaling challenges** - Manual scaling, limited by hardware capacity
- **Security responsibility** - You're responsible for security patches and updates
- **Availability management** - Must ensure runner uptime and reliability
- **Higher initial cost** - Upfront investment in hardware/cloud resources
- **Monitoring required** - Need to monitor runner health and performance

## When to Choose Which?

### Choose **Shared Runners** when:
- Small to medium teams with standard workflows
- Public repositories or **no private network requirements**
- Cost optimization for low to moderate usage
- Want **zero infrastructure management**
- Standard toolchain is sufficient

### Choose **Private Self-Hosted Runners** when:
- Need access to private/internal systems
- Require specific software or custom configurations
- High-volume builds make shared runners expensive
- **Strict security or compliance requirements**
- Need persistent storage between builds
- Want **full control** over the build environment
